This was an experiment in finding frictionless ways to get people to great, longform content. 

I put together an RSS feed from a few different sources (like Longreads, The New Yorker, etc). Via a rake task (scheduled daily on heroku), I check that feed for new links and add them to a database.

Each visitor to onegoodread.me is automatically redirected to a single piece of longform content, which is found by randomly selecting from the existing database of thinks.

To-do's might include user tracking (via cookie) to avoid duplicate links, and the concept of channels (such as onegoodread.me/cs for CS papers). 

There was a good discussion of the idea on Product Hunt: http://www.producthunt.com/posts/onegoodread
